\usage{
MADcomm(cache, datasets, delay = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{cache}{Folder where cached downloads are stored}

\item{datasets}{Character vector of datasets to be searched for
trait data. If not specified (the default) all trait datasets
will be downloaded and returned.}

\item{delay}{How long to wait between downloads (to save server
overload); default is 5 seconds.}
}
\value{
MADcomm.data object. XXX
}
\description{
The key function of the MADcomm package. When run with defaults, it
will download and build a database of species' traits from all the
manuscript sources in the package. This totals XXX
manuscripts/databases, XXX species, and XXX traits. Please note
that all parameters are interactive; thus specifying \code{species}
and \code{traits} constraints will constraint according to both,
for example. Please also note that specifying any kind of
constraints makes use of the package's built-in cache of what
species and traits information are available in each database;
making use of this on the GitHub (developer) build of this package
is not advisable, and (further) it is impossible for us to verify
whether the datasets NATDB searches have been updated since the
package was last built.
