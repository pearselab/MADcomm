Description: Automates the download and assembly of ecological assemblage
    data from published sources. This package is not a database, but
    rather Makes A Database of communities from published, existing
    sources. Those who have contributed community data that is downloaded
    should, of course, be appropriately referenced when their data are
    used (tools are available within this package to aid that). Some
    basic data checking, and functions to perform data checking, are
    included within this package, but the user should check their data
    before serious use.
